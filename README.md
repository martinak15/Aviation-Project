# Aviation-Project
## Project overview
This is a data analysis project in which I will assess the risks associated with different aircraft types for commercial and private operations to determine which aircraft have the lowest accident rates and severity levels to guide strategic purchasing decisions and company expansion.

## Business Understanding
### **Stakeholder**
The primary stakeholder is the **Head of the Aviation Division** at a company looking to expand into the aviation industry. The analysis will support decision-making regarding aircraft safety and operational risks.

### **Key Business Objectives**
To determine:
- Which aircraft models have the highest and lowest accident rates?
- What are the common causes of aviation accidents?
- Which phases of flight are most prone to accidents?
- How do accident trends vary over time?
- What safety recommendations can be made to minimize risks?


#### **1. Geographic Distribution of Accidents**

A bar chart highlighting that the highest number of fatalities occur in **personal flights**, followed by **unknown flight purposes** and **instructional flights**.

## **Conclusion**
### **Key Findings:**
1. **The majority of aviation accidents occur in the United States**, indicating a need for targeted safety measures in high-risk regions.
2. **Landing and takeoff phases have the highest accident rates**, emphasizing the importance of improving pilot training and aircraft safety during these critical moments.
3. **Personal flights account for the most fatalities**, suggesting that private aviation safety protocols may need to be strengthened.

### **Business Recommendations:**
- **Enhance pilot training for takeoff and landing** to minimize risks.
- **Invest in predictive maintenance and better in-flight monitoring systems** to prevent mid-air failures.
- **Improve aviation safety regulations for personal flights** by introducing stricter safety requirements.

This analysis provides valuable insights to help stakeholders make informed decisions when expanding into the aviation industry. The findings can guide safety improvements and risk management strategies for both commercial and private aviation operations.
